# Socket-Based-Virtual-Messaging
A C-based virtual communication system for sending and receiving text and files of any type. Each system has a limited "listening capacity," requiring large messages to be split into chunks and transmitted sequentially. This simulates real-world data transfer with controlled bandwidth per system.
